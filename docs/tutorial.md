# Tutorial

- Who this tutorial is for
- Scope and purpose: where will we be at the end of this tutorial?
- Introduction to Twitter and social media data
- Note that this tutorial can be done with the standard API track - academic access is not required, but some parts will point out additional functionality/approaches that can be done with academic access


## Motivating Example

- Describe the case study aims and objectives: why are we here?


## Before You Begin

- responsibilities when working with social media data
- Twitter developer access


## Installation and Setup

### Installing Python

### Installing Twarc

### Configuring Twarc


## What Can We Do with the Twitter API?

- Tour of Different API endpoints and how they map to platform affordances
- Different data types (primarily user focused/tweet focused endpoints)
- Different entity types on the Twitter platforms (URLs, hashtags, mentions, conversations etc)


## Introduction to Twitter Search

- Twitter search is boolean search!
- Overview of some useful operators and examples
- count first, retrieve tweets later
- End by actually collecting some data?


## Interlude: Handling Twitter JSON data

- Twitter JSON is complex relational data
- twarc-csv plugin as a starting point for some data transformation - other options
- Common gotchas with Twitter data (opening in excel breaks things)
- End with a transformation or exploratory analysis that shows something worth looking into further.


## Enriching Collected Data

- Based on analysis from the interlude, do something more collected, drawing on the advanced twarc2 CLI functionality likes searches, timelines or conversations


## Final Section: Use the Collected Data to Address the Movating Example

- Needs a better title
- Actually come up with an answer/insight/direction for future work using the collected data to address the question
