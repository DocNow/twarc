# twarc

twarc is a command line tool and Python library for archiving Twitter JSON
data. It has separate commands (twarc and twarc2) for working with the older
v1.1 API and the newer v2 API and Academic Access (respectively). It also has an ecosystem of [plugins](plugins) for doing things with the collected data. 

See the `twarc` documentation for running commands: [twarc2](twarc2_en_us.md) and [twarc1](twarc2_en_us.md) for using the v1.1 API. If you aren't sure about which one to use you'll want to start with twarc2 since the v1.1 is scheduled to be retired.

## Install

If you have python installed, you can install twarc using:

```
pip3 install twarc
```

Once installed, you should be able to use the twarc and twarc2 command line utilities, or use it as a Python library.
