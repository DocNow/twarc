# twarc v2 🐦🐍💾

twarc v2 is a *proposed* new version of [twarc] custom made for the new Twitter
v2 API. Twitter [substantially changed] their API in July 2020. They have
deprecated the v1.1 and premium endpoints. While some of the API calls seem
similar the most significant change is the response payload with is [totally
new]. The representation of a tweet now can take a very different shape
depending on what you ask for and how you ask for it. 

As with twarc the goal of twarc v2 is to make it easy to continue to get the
fullest representation of tweets and Twitter users, with the minimum amount of
fuss, and maximum amount of reliability. Here's a sketch of what the command
line API could look like.

### Search

```shell
twarc search blacklivesmatter > tweets.jsonl
```

If you have academic search turned on for your account:

```shell
twarc search blacklivesmatter --all > tweets.jsonl
```

### Filter

The [filter] API works a bit different in v2 because you first create a set
of rules (optionally tagged) and then you connect to the filter stream to
retrieve all the tweets that match those rules.

First you need to add a rule:

```shell
twarc add-filter-rule blacklivesmatter
```

List your rules:

```shell
twarc list-filter-rules
```

Start collecting tweets:

```
twarc filter > tweets.jsonl
```

Delete one of your rules using an id from the the output of `list-rules`:

```shell
twarc remove-filter-rule <rule-id>
```

### Sample

```shell
twarc sample > tweets.jsonl
```

### Followers

```shell
twarc followers jack > users.jsonl
```

### Following/Friends

```shell
twarc friends jack > users.jsonl
```

*Question: is being able to pipe to `twarc users` useful?*

### Users

Get users for user ids:

```shell
twarc users ids.txt > users.jsonl
```

Or get users for usernames:

```shell
twarc users usernames.txt > users.jsonl
```

### Timeline

```shell
twarc timeline jack > tweets.jsonl
```

### Mentions

```shell
twarc mentions jack > tweets.jsonl
```

### Hydrate

```shell
twarc hydrate ids.txt > tweets.jsonl
```

### Compliance

The [compliance] API is new and allows users to upload tweet id datasets
and get back information about whether the tweets are still available.
Since this can take some time for large datasets the ids are first uploaded
and then fetched.

First upload a set of tweet ids to check:

```shell
twarc add-compliance-job ids.txt
```

List the current compliance jobs, including their id and their status:

```shell
twarc list-compliance-jobs
```

Download and output the results of a completed compliance job:

```shell
twarc get-compliance-job <job-id>
```

### Stitching

The big difference with the v2 API is that some information (users, media,
etc) are not included inline in the tweets and are included as a separate
[extended entities] objects. This cuts down on duplication of information in
a payload (e.g. information about the same user, repeated over and over)
but it also means your output stream will contain individual tweets followed
by an entities object.

If you would like entities to replace the id references in tweets you
can use the `--stitch` option. Depending on your use case this could make
downstream processing easier since it can expect each line to contain
a complete tweet.

```shell
twarc search blacklivesmatter --stitch > tweets.jsonl
```

The proposed behavior is for this not to be the default since twarc has been
used in the past to display exactly what has been retrieved from the Twitter
API.

### Reports

Currently there is a utils directory with lots of different reporting tools
that mostly work as filters which read tweet JSON from stdin or files and
writing to stdout. This has been flexible because they are easy to edit in
isolation away from the complexity of the twarc library itself. It has been
easy for people to edit them and add new ones.

But these utilities have been difficult to install since they require
interacting with the GitHub repository and installing any dependencies that
they might have.

In twarc v2 we could use soemthing like [clik-plugins] move these reporting
tools to their own small repos and PyPi packages. Users could then pip install
the extensions they want and then run them using the twarc command:

```shell
pip install twarc-utils-geo
twarc utils geo tweets.json > tweets.geojson
```

Or something like that. I'm not entirely sure I understand how click-plugins
work yet but I really like the idea of moving to [click] to manage the
command-line-interface, so maybe it is viable?
