## Contributing 

### Documentation

The documentation is managed at ReadTheDocs. If you would like to improve the documentation you can edit the Markdown files in `docs` or add new ones. Then send a pull request and we can add it.

To view your documentation locally you should be able to:

    pip install -r requirements-mkdocs.txt
    mkdocs serve
    open http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If you prefer you can create a page on the [wiki](https://github.com/docnow/twarc/wiki/) to workshop the documentation, and then when/if you think it's ready to be merged with the documentation create an [issue](https://github.com/docnow/twarc/issues). Please feel free to create whatever documentation is useful in the wiki area.

### Code
